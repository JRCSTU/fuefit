Quick-start:
============

To install it, assuming you have download the sources,
do the usual::

    python setup.py install

Or get it directly from the PIP repository::

    pip3 install wltc


Tested with Python 3.4, supposed to run with 2.7.


Installation
============

The first step is to expand the .tgz archive in a temporary directory (not directly in Python's site-packages).
It contains a distutils setup file "setup.py". OS-specific installation instructions follow.

GNU/Linux, BSDs, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.
-------------------------------------

# Open a shell.

# Go to the directory created by expanding the archive::

 ``cd <archive_directory_path>``

# Install the package (you may need root permissions to complete this step)::

	su
	(enter admin password)
	python setup.py install

If the python executable isn't on your path, you'll have to specify the complete path, such as /usr/local/bin/python.

To install for a specific Python version, use this version in the setup call, e.g.::

	python3.1 setup.py install

To install for different Python versions, repeat step 3 for every required version. The last installed
version will be used in the `shebang line<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29>` of the ``rst2*.py`` wrapper scripts.


Windows
-------

Just double-click ``install.py``. If this doesn't work, try the following:

# Open a DOS Box (Command Shell, MS-DOS Prompt, or whatever they're calling it these days).

# Go to the directory created by expanding the archive::

	cd <archive_directory_path>

# Install the package::

	<path_to_python.exe>\python setup.py install

To install for a specific python version, specify the Python executable for this version.

To install for different Python versions, repeat step 3 for every required version.
